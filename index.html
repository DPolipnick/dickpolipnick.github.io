        <h2>My Summary</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I love learning- whether it's something new or diving deeper into a field I've already dabbled in.</li>
          <li>I started my first "legitimate" business in 2011 at age 14, when I was going door to door pulling a 1 cubic yard red trailer by hand with a push lawn mower and a single gas can. By age 16 I had employed 21 of my peers and by age 17 I had bought-out one of my competitors.</li>
          <li>Now, I operate my own "business incubator" holding company, Estopus Enterprises. With Estopus, I have pursued several business ventures throughout my career.</li>
          <li>Today, you can find me working on my passion and dream company, Online Growth Systems, helping our clients grow their companies through digital media. You can also find me reading a book, interviewing someone for my YouTube channel, or backpacking through Central America!</li>
